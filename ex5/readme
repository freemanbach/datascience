Future python programming DS assignment.

1) how many siemens cpu have machine cycle time with < 100 ns
2) how many sperry cpu have machine cycle time with < 100 ns
3) how many wang cpu have machine cycle time with < 100 ns
4) does higher max channel (chmax) played a role in decrease in machine cycle time ?
5) does lower min channel (chmin) played a role in decrease in machine cycle time ?

display them in a plot would be easy to see.
